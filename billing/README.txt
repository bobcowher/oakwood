INTRODUCTION
------------------

TheHostingTool (THT) is a PHP-based, open-source, client management script
geared towards free web hosting providers. THT is here to make your life
easier. If that's not the case for you, please file an issue report and
let us know exactly where we can improve.

INSTALLATION
------------------

Visit /install to get started. We think this is pretty simple, but just in case:

UPGRADING
----------------

The latest version of THT can only be upgraded on top of the release directly before it.

GETTING HELP
-------------------

We have our own IRC channel, #tht on freenode. It rarely gets used but try popping in
there once and see if anybody is around. The best way to get support is by posting on
our forums. Please refrain from emailing team members with THT related support
questions as they are best handled on the forum. We also have another #THT IRC
channel on irc.expertec.co.uk
