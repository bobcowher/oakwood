== Description ==

**What Tweaker3 is NOT**

This is not a theme where you click a few buttons in an options page thinking that this will magically cover all the customizations you could possibly require. With Tweaker3 you will have to get your hands dirty in the code when it comes to customization. Just like all the themes released by Tweaker Themes this one is aimed specifically at the WordPress user who wants to customize his/her theme. The theme itself is styled in such a way to make things as easy as possible to make your changes.

Tweaker3 does not contain all the bells and whistles with regards to functionality. These things, in my opinion, have no place in a theme, this functionality belongs in plugins and/or widgets.

**What Tweaker3 IS**

* Custom menus have been implemented.
* Custom headers can be set up from the back-end.
* Provision has also been made for custom backgrounds.
* Support for Post Formats, that will be available from WordPress 3.1 has also been included.
* The Superfish drop-down menu has been built in. It goes without saying that the Javascript portion of this menu will only work if support for Javascript has been turned on.
* The theme is translation ready.
* The theme is ready for WP-PageNavi, all you need do is to activate the plugin.
* There are 4 widgetized areas, one in the sidebar and 3 just above the footer.
* The CSS used validates.
* The XHTML used also validates as far as the WordPress core code allows it to.
* Two page templates are included, one for wide content pages and another for a sitemap.
* On the main, search and archive pages the excerpts of the articles are shown if they exist. If there is no excerpt the normal content is shown up to the more-link. If no more-link has been added the full content will be shown. The user now has got full control of what is shown for each article.
* All the code templates have additional documentation in the code to assist with customization.
* Support for the theme is available via a support forum.
